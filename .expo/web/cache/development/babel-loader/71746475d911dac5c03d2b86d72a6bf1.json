that a particular breed of pet will prevent allergic reactions. For instance, allergies to dogs often come from a reaction to the dog’s saliva rather than from their fur. If you are concerned about pet allergies, please consult with the adoption agency directly to receive personalised recommendations for your condition.\r\n\r\n                </Text>\r\n                <Text style={styles.tex1}>\r\n                    {'\\u2022'}Cats and dogs are enemies: although commonly portrayed this way in movies, cats and dogs can be great company for each other; particularly if they are raised together.
